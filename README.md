# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project provides an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset, which contains information on passengers who were aboard the Titanic. The analysis explores various factors such as survival rate, age, gender, and other demographic variables to uncover insights related to the Titanic tragedy.

# Project Overview

The Titanic dataset is a classic in data science, often used to practice data cleaning, visualization, and model building. This project focuses on analyzing the dataset to understand key insights and relationships between different features such as gender, age, ticket class, and survival rate. Through this analysis, we aim to gain a better understanding of the factors that influenced survival.

# Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and transforming the data for analysis.
- **Data Exploration**: Analyzing various attributes like age, gender, class, and survival.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizing patterns and correlations within the dataset.
- **Survival Insights**: Uncovering factors that may have influenced survival rates.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic passenger dataset, which contains information on passengers such as name, age, gender, ticket class, and survival status.

**Data Source**: [Kaggle - Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

# Technologies

- **Python**: For data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced statistical data visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: For basic plotting and data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For conducting and presenting the analysis.
