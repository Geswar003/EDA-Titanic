# Project Overview

The Titanic dataset is one of the most well-known datasets used for predictive analysis. In this project, we perform EDA on the dataset, identifying key factors such as age, gender, and socio-economic status that contributed to the survival rates of passengers. The project provides visual insights into the data that can be valuable for both analysts and data scientists.

# Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Data Exploration**: Investigating key features like age, gender, fare, and passenger class to discover patterns.
- **Survival Rate Analysis**: Analyzing factors that contributed to passenger survival.
- **Data Visualization**: Graphical representations of survival trends and passenger demographics.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic passenger data, which provides details about passengers, including their age, sex, class, and survival status.

**Data Source**: [Kaggle - Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

# Technologies

- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating insightful visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For developing and presenting the analysis.
